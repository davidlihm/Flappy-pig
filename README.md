This is our project of Computer Game Design and Development course, worked by two of my group members, Ma and Chen, and me.

Based on another project on github
https://github.com/harunurhan/flappy-bird-game-unity3d

Two screenshot of this game are attached.

We added another pig and assigned them a special skill.

In addition, new model, new texture, BGMs.

Also, make some modification on the tube generation program to make the difficulty more reality. The original version is too easy.
